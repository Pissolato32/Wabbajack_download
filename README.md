# Wabbajack_download
A Python script to bypass the Nexus API limit on mod downloads.

Free Nexus Mods accounts have a download limit when using the official API. This script is designed to overcome that restriction by automating the process, making it ideal for large modpacks—such as those for Skyrim with over 4,000 mods—where manually clicking through each download would be impractical.

In short, this is a local script that automates clicking for you.
